## What is Skill tree?

Skilltree is an app that brings the concept of RPG skill trees into real life. I grew up with final fantasy X, the sphere grid system was very mesmerizing, so I thought why not make it a real thing? and so I made this. It's a way for users to set goals and track their progress in a fun and interactive way.

> Edit (7/5/2023): This app right here was my first real dev project, I got to implement every feature I wanted to learned and try out through this app, and it looks quite nice for a first project

## Features

The app allows you to create your own personalized skill tree, with different branches representing different skills or goals that you want to achieve. You can assign experience points (XP) to each branch, and as you complete tasks and achieve goals in real life, you earn XP that goes towards leveling up that branch.

For example, if you wanted to learn a new language, you could create a language branch on your skill tree. You would assign XP to it and set specific goals, such as completing a certain number of lessons or practicing for a certain amount of time each day. As you achieve those goals, you earn XP and your language branch levels up.
